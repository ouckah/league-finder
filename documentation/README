For this code to work, you must have a valid Riot API key (can be generated from https://developer.riotgames.com for free.)
The API key expires every 24hrs and must be renewed daily. We will try our best to supply you with the renewed API key in the assignment comments.
If you have a working riot API key, you can replace the RIOT_API_KEY in the .env file.

Use 'npm i' to install all dependencies and 'npm run seed' to seed the database.

After doing the above step, run the application using 'npm start'. The application can be found at 'localhost:3000'.
